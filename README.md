> A community‑driven, SentinelOne‑assisted library of **parsers, dashboards, detections & response playbooks** that supercharge the Singularity Platform.

---

## Why this repository exists  
* Unite scattered content and eliminate “hunt‑the‑snippet” time for engineers and customers.  
* Enforce automated quality gates so every artifact is production‑ready.  
* Foster an open ecosystem where field teams, partners, and customers co‑create knowledge objects.

## Repository layout
```
AISIEM/                # AI SIEM core content (parsing, dashboards, detections, responses)
install-tools/         # Bootstrap & validation scripts for local or tenant‑side installation
CNS/                   # Cloud Native Security content packs
```

---

## Quick start
1. **Clone** the repo and select the folder that matches your use‑case.  
2. **Import** dashboards (`*.ndjson`) or rules (`*.s1ql`) into your Singularity console.  
3. **Automate** actions by deploying playbooks in **responses/** with HyperAutomation or Terraform.  
4. *(Optional)* run `make test` to replay sample logs and validate detections locally.

---

## Contribution guide
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.  
2. Name files `vendor-usecase-vX.Y.<ext>` and add a matching `metadata.yml`.  
3. Run `yamllint` & `s1ql-lint`; ensure all tests pass.  
4. Include or update sample logs under `tests/fixtures`.  
5. Open a Pull Request – CI will run lint, replay tests, secret scanning and CodeQL.  
6. At least one **CODEOWNER** review is required before merge.

Detailed steps live in **docs/CONTRIBUTING.md**.

## Automation & quality gates
| Stage        | What it does                                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static lint  | `yamllint` + `s1ql‑lint`                                                            |
| Replay test  | Replays sample logs against a disposable tenant; allows ≤ 0.1 % false‑positives     |
| Security     | Secret scanning & CodeQL                                                            |
| Release      | Semantic‑release tags `vX.Y.Z` and publishes artifacts to GitHub Releases & S3      |
